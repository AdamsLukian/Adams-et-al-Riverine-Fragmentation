### Adams-et-al-Riverine-Fragmentation
This code accompanies Adams et al. (2024)

The code here can be used to clean and analyse abundance data of riverine organisms to quantify and investigate fragmentation

Raw fish abundance and artificial barrier data associated with this code is available via a Data Sharing Agreement with the NSW Department of Primary Industries which can be applied for at https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/fishing/fisheries-research/freshwater-ecosystems/freshwater-data-request

A scrambled version of original raw data is provided to allow for walkthrough of code
